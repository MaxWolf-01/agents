description: Post-implementation reflection within session

Look back at what you just implemented. Be honest, be critical.

- Where was the friction during implementation? What fought you?
- What assumptions did you make that you weren't sure about?
- Now that you've seen all the pieces — would you approach it differently?
- Is the architecture working with or against this feature?
- Any hacks, shortcuts, or "I'll fix this later" moments?
- Does the result actually match the intent?

Don't soften things. If something is ugly, say it's ugly. If the approach was wrong, say so. The point is to surface what you noticed while implementing but didn't stop to address.
